# INSTALL.md — set up this repo on a new machine, for a congregation

This file is written **for you, the agent**, not for the human. Read it top to bottom and
execute it as a checklist, in order — most steps only make sense after the one before.
The human present is either a technical admin or church staff; when a step needs facts
only they have, ask for exactly that fact and nothing else, wait for the answer, and
keep going. Do not skip a step because it looks optional — each one exists because a
past run needed it.

This installs the tool as-is for **another IPUC congregation**. The brand (logo, colors,
fonts) is the organization's, shared by every congregation on purpose, and lives in code
(`video/src/brand/tokens.ts`, `brand/`) — see CLAUDE.md § Scope. If the person setting up
is *not* an IPUC congregation, stop after step 0 and say so: reusing the code for a
different brand is a real rewrite (new tokens, new logo, new motifs), not a config change,
and is out of scope for this file.

Read `CLAUDE.md` and `PLAN.md` §6 (Environment) before starting; this file only sequences
what they already document — it does not restate the reasoning.

## Step 0 — Confirm scope

Ask: "¿Esta instalación es para otra congregación de la IPUC?" If no, stop here and say
why (see above) instead of proceeding.

## Step 1 — Get the code onto this machine

If this file is already present, the repo is already here — skip to step 2. Otherwise:

```bash
git clone <the repo's URL, given by the person> decom-skills
cd decom-skills
```

There is no root `package.json`: everything under `scripts/` runs on Node's built-ins
only (`node:fs`, `node:path`, `node:child_process`, …). The only install step is `video/`
(step 3).

## Step 2 — Verify Node

```bash
node -v
```

Needs Node 22 or newer (built and verified on v22.23.2). If `node` is not found, look for
an existing nvm install before asking the person to install one:

```bash
ls "$HOME/.nvm/versions/node/" 2>/dev/null
export PATH="$HOME/.nvm/versions/node/<version found>/bin:$PATH"
```

If nothing is there, ask the person to install Node 22+ (nvm is the least surprising way
on Linux) and re-run this step.

## Step 3 — Install the Remotion project's dependencies

```bash
(cd video && npm install)
```

This is the only `npm install` in the repo. Confirm it finished without errors before
continuing.

## Step 4 — Verify rendering works on this machine

Remotion bundles its own ffmpeg inside
`video/node_modules/@remotion/compositor-linux-*-gnu/` — there is no system ffmpeg to
install. Confirm the package matching this machine's arch is present:

```bash
ls video/node_modules/@remotion/ | grep compositor
```

Remotion also needs a Chromium. Try letting it use its own first:

```bash
(cd video && npx remotion still HelloWorld /tmp/install-check.png 2>&1 | tail -20)
```

(`HelloWorld` may not exist as a composition name in this project — if it errors with
"composition not found," that's fine, it proves Chromium launched; a browser-launch error
is the one to act on.)

- If Chromium fails to **download**, or launches but crashes with missing shared
  libraries: on Linux, run `ldd` on Remotion's `headless_shell` binary (find it under
  `video/node_modules/@remotion/`) and install whatever it reports missing
  (`libnss3`, `libnspr4`, and similar — the exact list is machine-specific). If the
  person cannot install system packages, find or ask for an existing Chromium binary on
  the machine and set `REMOTION_BROWSER_EXECUTABLE` to its path; `render.mjs` and
  `remotion still`/`studio` fall back to Remotion's own Chromium when it is unset, so
  this is additive, not a config file to edit.
- Clean up the scratch file afterward: `rm -f /tmp/install-check.png`.

Do not attempt to install a system ffmpeg or ffprobe — the bundled one is deliberately
used instead (see CLAUDE.md § Environment); if audio-level measurement is ever needed,
decode to `pcm_s16le` WAV and compute RMS in Node, not with `ffprobe -af volumedetect`
(the bundled build is trimmed and lacks it).

## Step 5 — Connect Google Calendar

This is the step most likely to trip someone up, because it is **not** a repo file, not
an `.env` value, and not something in Claude Code's `/plugin` marketplace. It is a
**claude.ai account-level connector**: Google's own remote MCP server
(`https://calendarmcp.googleapis.com/mcp/v1`), tied to whichever account is logged into
Claude Code, not to this project.

Check first:

```bash
claude mcp list
```

Look for a line reading `claude.ai Google Calendar: ... - ✔ Connected`. If it's there,
this step is already done — skip to verification below.

If it's missing (or shows "Needs authentication"), do **not** look in `/plugin` — that
manages Claude Code's own plugins (skills/agents/bundled MCP servers), which is a
different system. You may also see a decoy line like
`plugin:engineering:google calendar: ... - Not configured`: that belongs to an unrelated
plugin and is never the one this project needs, even though the name is nearly
identical. Instead, tell the person plainly:

1. Sign in to **claude.ai** in a browser, on the account that will run Claude Code here.
2. Go to **Settings → Connectors**, connect **Google Calendar**, and authorize the
   Google account that has the church's calendar. (Whether this needs a paid claude.ai
   plan is worth them checking on that page — do not assume either way.)
3. Back here, run `claude mcp list` again (a fresh Claude Code session may be needed) and
   confirm it now shows `✔ Connected`.

This is an OAuth flow only the person can complete — do not attempt it on their behalf.

Once connected, verify with `list_calendars` and confirm at least one calendar name
contains the new congregation's name (the `church-ads` skill matches calendars this way
later). If none does, that's fine — it will just mean asking the person to name the
calendar explicitly on the first real run.

## Step 6 — ElevenLabs credentials

`.env` at the repo root is git-ignored and holds two values `scripts/tts.mjs` reads
(directly, or via the `ELEVENLABS_*` spelling):

```
ELEVEN_LABS_API_KEY=...
ELEVEN_LABS_VOICE_ID=...
```

Ask the person for both, one at a time:

1. **`ELEVEN_LABS_API_KEY`** — their ElevenLabs API key. Note for them: voices from
   ElevenLabs' shared library (the usual choice for a Colombian Spanish voice) only work
   over the API on a **paid** ElevenLabs plan (the free tier returns
   `402 paid_plan_required`) — ask whether their plan is paid before treating a later
   `402` as a bug.
2. **`ELEVEN_LABS_VOICE_ID`** — the ID of the voice they want. If they don't have one
   picked yet, the ElevenLabs MCP connector (`creative_list_voices`) is a good way to
   audition candidates together — pick a Latin-American Spanish voice; PLAN.md §Phase 0
   for context. This ID is the one thing that is genuinely per-congregation in `.env`;
   the model and voice *settings* are shared and already committed in `scripts/voice.json`
   — do not ask about those unless the person specifically wants a different model or
   stability/similarity setting.

Write the file yourself once both values are given:

```bash
cat > .env <<'EOF'
ELEVEN_LABS_API_KEY=<value the person gave>
ELEVEN_LABS_VOICE_ID=<value the person gave>
EOF
```

**Never print these values back**, in this step or later, and never commit `.env` (it is
already in `.gitignore` — do not remove that line).

## Step 7 — This congregation's facts

`church-info.md` at the repo root is what makes this copy of the tool belong to *this*
congregation instead of the one it was copied from — it is tracked in git (not a secret)
but every congregation's copy has its own. If the repo still has another congregation's
`church-info.md`, it must be replaced now, not merged.

Show the person `church-info.example.md` (or just its field list) and ask, in plain
Spanish since this is church staff, for their own version of each — free text, no format
required, typos are fine, and anything they skip is simply absent from the ads, never
guessed:

- **Nombre** — el nombre de la congregación (se dice una vez en la bienvenida del video).
- **Direccion** — aparece en el cierre del video.
- **Lugar por defecto** — dónde es un evento cuando su tarjeta no dice nada.
- **Ministerios** — los grupos de la iglesia (Jóvenes, Familias...), para etiquetar el
  público de cada evento.
- **Llamado a la accion** — la frase que cierra el video de la semana (por ejemplo, "Te
  esperamos").
- **Despedida** (opcional) — lo que se dice justo después (por ejemplo, "Dios te
  bendiga").
- **Servicios recurrentes** — el día y la hora de inicio de cada culto fijo de la semana,
  y su nombre si hay dos el mismo día (por ejemplo, uno de damas y otro de caballeros).

Write their answers to `church-info.md` in that same free-text style (a list is fine, see
`church-info.example.md`). Do not invent or infer any of these facts — an empty field
stays empty, exactly as hard rule 1 requires for events later.

## Step 8 — Confirm shared brand assets need no changes

Nothing to do here for an IPUC congregation — the logo (`brand/logo/`), the identity
manual (`brand/corporate-brand.md`), the color/type tokens
(`video/src/brand/tokens.ts`), and the seven cached motif images
(`video/public/motifs/*.png`) are the organization's, already committed, and shared by
every congregation by design (CLAUDE.md § Scope). Just confirm they're present:

```bash
ls brand/logo/ video/public/motifs/
```

One known, pre-existing gap worth mentioning to the person once: the brand manual's
typeface (Myriad Pro) is not vendored, so renders currently use Montserrat as a
placeholder (`brand/fonts/`). This is a standing to-do for the org, not something to fix
per-installation.

## Step 9 — Smoke-test the install

```bash
(cd video && npx tsc --noEmit)
```

This alone proves Node, `npm install` and the TypeScript toolchain are sound. It does not
exercise rendering or TTS — do not fabricate a fake week to test those; the real proof is
running the `church-ads` skill on the congregation's actual first week once the person is
ready, which will exercise Google Calendar, `.env`, and Chromium/ffmpeg together end to
end.

## Step 10 — Report back

Tell the person, plainly, what is now true and what is still open:

- Node, `video/`'s dependencies, and rendering are confirmed working on this machine.
- Whether Google Calendar is connected, or still needs their action (step 5).
- `.env` is written (never repeat the values).
- `church-info.md` now has this congregation's facts (name what was written).
- The Montserrat/Myriad Pro gap (step 8), so it isn't a surprise later.
- That the tool is ready for its first real week — offer to run it now if they'd like:
  "Haz los anuncios de esta semana."
