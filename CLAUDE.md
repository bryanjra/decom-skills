# CLAUDE.md

Generator of weekly advertisement videos for the IPUC (Iglesia Pentecostal Unida
de Colombia) congregations; today, IPUC Envigado Central. Reads a week of events
from Google Calendar and produces, per event, a branded image and a video clip,
plus one Spanish narration for the whole week — then edits them into one weekly
video.

**Scope: the IPUC organization only.** Every congregation shares the
organization's identity (colors, logo, fonts), so the brand lives in code on
purpose (`video/src/brand/tokens.ts`, `brand/`). Do not move it into
`church-info.md` or generalize it to other brands. Only each congregation's own
facts change (its name, address, services), and those live in `church-info.md`.

Read `PLAN.md` first: it holds the build contract, the phase breakdown and the
verified feasibility findings.

## Hard rules

1. **Never invent event facts.** Times, places, names and details may only come
   from the event card, `church-info.md`, or the user. A wrong time in a church
   ad sends real people to a locked door, so what is unknown stays *absent*: an
   event whose time cannot be found is advertised by date only. Doubts about an
   event are asked once, in plain Spanish, at a checkpoint before anything is
   made, each with a safe suggested answer that is only a guide, never a
   default: every numbered doubt needs the user's own answer, and nothing is
   made while one is open. What does block is an integrity error: an
   `inferido` time source, a malformed time, a duplicate slug, an override that
   names no event. `events.json` carries `horaFuente` for exactly this;
   `scripts/validate.mjs` audits it before rendering. A recurring service from
   `church-info.md` with no calendar card of its own is an ad by default too —
   assumed well known, but it still happens — unless the user, asked, says it
   is not happening this week.
2. **All audience-facing output is in Spanish** (Colombia), addressing the
   reader as `tú` — never `usted`. The closing call to action is the church's
   own, from `church-info.md` (`Llamado a la accion`; for IPUC Envigado Central
   it is "Te esperamos"), spoken once, in the weekly outro, followed by the
   church's `Despedida` if it has one ("Dios te bendiga"); event lines carry
   neither. If the file has none, the ads have none. Code, comments and these
   docs are in English; `README.md`, the church team's guide, is the exception
   and is in Spanish.
3. **All video is 16:9, 1920x1080, 30fps.** Templates must re-layout rather than
   hardcode, so 9:16 remains possible later.
4. **Subagents never render.** They write components. The orchestrator writes
   the week's narration, voices it once and renders — rendering is CPU-bound
   and must be serialized.
5. **`video/src/brand/tokens.ts` is the single source of truth** for colors,
   spacing and type scale. No hardcoded hex values in ad components. It holds
   the IPUC's identity, in code by design (see Scope).
6. **Church facts are reference data, never code.** Name, address, default
   place, ministries, call to action, blessing (`Despedida`) and recurring
   services come from
   `church-info.md`, free text that the orchestrator reads (no code parses it;
   `church-info.example.md` only suggests what to say); the time zone comes from
   the calendar itself. Nothing about a specific congregation is written in
   `scripts/` or `video/src/` (the organization's brand is not a congregation's
   fact), so another IPUC congregation reuses the tool by swapping only
   `church-info.md`. Tests and their fixtures use a fictional church ("Iglesia
   Ejemplo"): no real congregation's name, not even as a calendar name.

## Commands

Run them from the repo root with a subshell for `video/`, so the working
directory does not drift.

```bash
node scripts/normalize.mjs --week 2026-W39    # raw calendar -> out/<week>/events.json
node scripts/validate.mjs 2026-W39 [slug] [--narracion]   # audit events.json, each ad, the week's guion.md
node scripts/gen-registry.mjs                 # rebuild video/src/ads/registry.gen.ts
node scripts/tts.mjs --week 2026-W39            # the week's one voiceover (costs money)
node scripts/render.mjs 2026-W39 [slug]       # stills, clips, then semana.mp4
node --test scripts/test/*.test.mjs           # unit tests (use the glob)

(cd video && npx remotion studio)                      # live preview
(cd video && npx remotion still <CompId> out/x.png)    # one frame as PNG
(cd video && npx tsc --noEmit)                         # type-check
```

`render.mjs` is the way to render a week; the raw `remotion` commands are for
previewing a single composition.

## Environment

Harness is the Claude Code CLI. Machine setup is assumed done and is not
tracked in this repo.

- Node 22+ (verified on v22.23.2), on arm64 Linux. In the Claude Code Bash tool
  `node` is not on PATH: run
  `export PATH="$HOME/.nvm/versions/node/v22.23.2/bin:$PATH"` first.
- There is no system `ffmpeg`/`ffprobe`. Remotion bundles them in
  `video/node_modules/@remotion/compositor-linux-arm64-gnu/`; set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`
  to that directory or they fail to load. That build is trimmed: no `volumedetect`,
  `astats` or `s16le`. To measure audio levels, decode to `pcm_s16le` WAV and
  compute the RMS in Node.
- `.env` (git-ignored) holds `ELEVEN_LABS_API_KEY` and `ELEVEN_LABS_VOICE_ID`;
  `scripts/core/tts.mjs` also accepts the `ELEVENLABS_*` spelling. Never print
  their values. The voice ID lives there, while the model and voice settings are
  in `scripts/voice.json` (version-controlled). TTS goes through
  `scripts/tts.mjs` against the REST API — not the MCP connector — so that a past
  week re-renders identically.
- Git has no user identity or credentials configured here. Commit with
  `git -c user.name=Claude -c user.email=noreply@anthropic.com commit ...` (the
  repo's history is authored that way) and push with
  `git -c credential.helper='!gh auth git-credential' push ...`, which uses the
  existing `gh` login; neither changes any git config. Do not commit on `main`:
  branch first, merge only when asked.
- `REMOTION_BROWSER_EXECUTABLE` — optional. Set it to an existing Chromium when
  Remotion cannot download its own (see `PLAN.md` § Environment). Render scripts
  fall back to Remotion's default when unset. On Linux, Remotion's own headless
  Chromium also needs system libraries (`libnss3`, `libnspr4`, ...); `ldd` on
  its `headless_shell` names any that are missing.

## Conventions

- Remotion animations are driven by `useCurrentFrame()` + `interpolate()`. CSS
  `transition`/`animation` and Tailwind animation classes do **not** render.
- Scene durations come from the voiceover's per-character timing
  (`voz.alineacion.json`), turned into props by `scripts/core/render-plan.mjs`;
  `calculateMetadata` only sums them and checks the mp3 against that timing —
  never hardcoded frame counts for ad scenes.
- The week's script is `out/<week>/guion.md`: `## intro`, one `## <slug>` per
  event, `## outro`, written by the orchestrator (rules: `.claude/skills/church-ads/script.md`).
- One component per event at `video/src/ads/<slug>.tsx`, props-driven so it can
  be re-rendered from `events.json` alone.
- Slugs are lowercase, accent-stripped, hyphenated: `Charla familias` ->
  `charla-familias`.
- Code does dates and numbers; the orchestrator reads the words. The calendar
  titles and `church-info.md` are typed by non-technical staff, so no code parses
  them: after a first `normalize` run the orchestrator writes
  `out/<week>/lectura.json` (the church facts; per event its clean title, time,
  place, ministry and modality, each with its source; and `recurrentes`, the
  week's recurring services that have no calendar card of their own) and runs
  `normalize` again. Checkpoint 1 is the only gate on that reading. A calendar
  event's time is taken from, in order: the card (code), then the title
  (`2pm ...`) — `church-info.md` no longer fills in a card's time. A recurring
  service with no card is an ad by default (assumed well known, but it still
  happens); code places it on its weekday with `horaFuente: "church-info.md"`.
  Whether a same-day card *is* that service, or a second event alongside it, is
  never decided by code: a clear match retires the service for the week; a real
  doubt (an untimed or same-time card, or one that may be a second service — two
  can share a day, e.g. men's and women's services in different rooms) is asked
  at Checkpoint 1. No match anywhere means no time. Human answers go in
  `overrides/<week>.json`, keyed by slug (`hora`, `lugar`, `modalidad`,
  `plantilla`, `omitir`); `hora: null` and `lugar: null` announce the event
  without it, and a recurring service's slug (`servicio-<día>[-<hhmm>]`) is
  stable week to week so `omitir` reliably drops just that one. The orchestrator
  writes that file from the user's answers; users never edit it. See
  `.claude/skills/church-ads/SKILL.md`.
- The users are non-technical church staff, so the orchestrator proposes instead
  of asking for a perfect prompt: the week (current one Mon-Fri, the upcoming one
  on Sat/Sun) and the calendars whose name contains the church's. It talks to them
  in plain Spanish (`tú`; never slug, override, JSON or ISO week) in two
  checkpoints: one before anything is made (the events grouped by day, with the
  time and place each will use, and only the real doubts, each needing the
  person's own answer, one by one) and one showing the script before the paid
  voice. Details in the skill.
- The church name reaches the audience in two places only. The voice says it once,
  in the weekly intro ("Bienvenidos a <name>"), and `validate.mjs` checks the intro
  against `church-info.md`. On screen it appears only through `Logo`: the logo image
  carries it, and only when `brand.logo` is null does `Logo` draw the name as a
  wordmark, reading it from `IglesiaProvider` (`video/src/church.tsx`, wrapped once
  in `EventAd` and `WeeklyReel`); this org does not need that fallback. By the
  script rules, event lines and the outro do not say the name, so a single-event
  clip never speaks it. An ad never types the name, reads `iglesia.nombre` (by
  property or by destructuring) or calls `useIglesia()`: `scripts/core/ad-source.mjs`
  rejects those (`nombre-literal`, `nombre-en-texto`). Aliasing
  (`const i = iglesia; i.nombre`) cannot be detected, so review catches it.
- Work on `scripts/` test-first (`node --test scripts/test/*.test.mjs`). Remotion
  components have no test harness: check them with `tsc --noEmit` and a rendered
  still. To see a token-dependent path (for example the no-logo wordmark), change
  the token temporarily, render a still to a scratch directory, and restore the
  file.
- The `destacado` template is only ever chosen through an override.
- Never name a directory `lib`: the `.gitignore` is the Python template and
  ignores it.
- Generated output lives in `out/<YYYY>-W<NN>/` and is disposable; never edit it
  by hand.

## Decision: Claude reads the words (2026-09-21)

The calendar titles and `church-info.md` are typed by non-technical staff, so no code
parses them. Code does dates and numbers; the orchestrator reads the words and hands its
reading to `normalize` as `out/<week>/lectura.json` (see the `church-ads` skill, *Reading
the calendar and church-info.md*). It replaced `core/church-info.mjs` and
`core/titulo.mjs`.

**What it buys.** Staff can write `church-info.md` and titles any way they like. The real
file already strained the parser (`8: 00 PM`, a service with no dash, two Saturday
services, a "Culto" on a Saturday that no title matcher could place). Reading handles
"Ayuno Evangelismo" as the Saturday fast and flags "Distrito 9" as possibly held
elsewhere. Run on the real W39 calendar, the reading matched the old parser event for
event, except the district event, which is the one that should differ.

**What it costs.** Determinism, and any code-level proof that a time attributed to
`church-info.md` is in it: nothing checks the reading against the file. The safety net is
Checkpoint 1, where the person sees every time and place with its source, plus the audit
that stays (`inferido`, malformed time, duplicate slug). A re-run may read the same file
differently. The reading is rewritten each run, so an edit to `church-info.md` always
applies, while the person's answers persist in `overrides/`. This trade is deliberate: it
is a simple use case, and a person confirming a plain list is enough.

**Lessons.**
- Do not put a format on a file staff type. Do not bring back a parser, a regex or a
  `Label: value` requirement for `church-info.md` or titles, and do not add citations,
  quote verification or other traceability layers. A wrong reading is fixed in the
  skill's instructions or by the person's answer, not in code.
- Keep in code what a model gets wrong silently and code gets right: the week range, time
  zones, all-day exclusive ends, slugs, the Spanish date and time wording.
- A silent failure is worse than a loud one. `validate.mjs` errors when `events.json` has
  no church name, so a forgotten `lectura.json` cannot skip the intro and outro checks; an
  event id in the reading that names no event is an error (the ids are long and opaque, so
  typos happen); a malformed `hora` in the reading is a problem and is ignored.
- Do not unit-test the reasoning. Test what code does (the merge, the precedence, the
  problems) and check the reading by running the flow on real calendar data and comparing.
- Deleting beat adding: the change removed about 690 lines and added about 300, mostly
  docs.
